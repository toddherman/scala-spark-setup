Dear Barbara Whitman:
We have reviewed your Section 51 O(k) premarket notification of intent to Inarket the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You Inay, therefore, nlarket the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act.
The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability
warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.
If your device is classified (see above) into either cl~ss II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA),
it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be
found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has tnade a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 80 I); medical device reporting (reporting of medical
device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
Page 2 - Barbara Whitman
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Division of Industry and Consumer Education at its toll-free nUlnber (800) 638-2041
or (301) 796-7100 or at its Internet address
http://www.foa.gov/MedicaIDevices/ResollrcesforYou/Industly/default.htm. Also, please note
the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part
807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21

The Bio Compression Systems, Inc. SC-2004-0C Sequential Circulator and SC-2008-0C Sequential
Circulator, are pneumatic compression devices ('pumps') with associated compressible garment sleeves.
The pumps are manually adjusted by the user to produce air pressure to inflate and deflate segmented
inflatable chambers of garment sleeves. The garment sleeves are externally applied over affected
extremities. The pumps consist of compressors capable of producing a maximum pressure of 80 mmHg
and provide graduated or gradient pressurization to the chambers of the garments. The sequential
inflation is applied distally to proximally with distal chambers inflated to a greater pressure than
proximal ones.

Special 510(k) Device Modification
Sequential Circulators SC-2004-0C/SC-2008-0C
As each chamber is inflated, the pressure is held constant until all chambers are inflated, in order to
prevent reverse gradient flow. Once all of the chambers are inflated, they are then simultaneously
released and the cycle repeats. The user can adjust the Pressure Knob on the front of the device for
desired pressure.
Associated garments are available in a variety of standard sizes. The pumps can operate unilaterally and
bilaterally as needed.
Indications For Use
The Bio Compression Systems Sequential Circulator SC-2008-0C/Sequential Circulator SC-2004-0C with
associated garments are sequential, pneumatic compression devices intended for the primary or
adjunctive treatment of primary or secondary lymphedema. The devices are also intended for the
additional or alternate treatment of venous insufficiency and chronic venous stasis ulcers associated
with venous insufficiency, as well as, general treatment for swelling of the extremities. The devices are
intended for home or hospital use.
Description of Device Modifications/Technological Characteristics:
The Sequential Circulators SC-2004-0C and SC-2008-0C are technologically similar to the predicate
devices, SC-3008 Sequential Circulator (K043423) and SC-2004 Sequential Circulator (Preamendment
Device). The modification was the removal of the pressurization display gauge from the front of the
device. The Pressure Knob, used to set the desired pressurization, remains substantially equivalent to
that of the predicate device. The removal of the display was ease of use for the end user. Once the
desired pressure is indicated by setting the Pressure Knob, the end user does not need to read any
displays, as the pressurization is consistent with the desired setting.
The modification to the subject devices has not altered the fundamental technology of the predicate
devices.
Performance Data
Before being released to market, every device is tested and must meet all performance specifications.
In addition to aesthetic acceptance criteria, functional testing includes electrical leakage, pressure
adjustment, inflation pressure in each chamber, air pressure display accuracy, and inflation/deflation
cycle times. The results demonstrate comparable inflation cycle profiles (rise times, inflation pressures,
deflation times, and cycle times) between the applicant and predicate devices.
Statement of Substantial Equivalence:
Based upon risk management, safety & performance testing, compliance with voluntary standards, and
comparison to predicate devices, the Sequential Circulators SC-2004-0C and SC-2008-0C, are
substantially equivalent to the predicate devices SC-3008 Sequential Circulator and the SC-2004
Sequential Circulator. The modified devices do not introduce any new potential safety risks and are
substantially equivalent to the predicate devices.
